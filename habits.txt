1.	First habit is important not only in programming, but in most of the jobs.
We have only one health and we should take care of it. 
Also programmer needs to focus most of the time, so great sleep is a must.
2.	I need to learn this habit, because I am exactly like that. 
When I was creating some school programs, or some games for gamejams, I was able to spend huge amount of time on some feature. 
I wanted it to be perfect in any way. But at the end I was just wasting time, not doing what was really needed. 
And the truth is, that some times I didnt even use these features in project.
3.	This is very important. Write simple and readable code, so that one day my colleagues (or future self) will thank me :)
4.	In the past it was really hard for me to get in „the zone“, because I got distracted with every little sound around me. 
But now its much better. Usually when I try to code or focus, I put my headphones on, turn some non-distract music so I will not hear traffic and other noise around me. 
5.	I think no comment is needed here, technologies are constantly changing and evolving, so we have to adapt.
